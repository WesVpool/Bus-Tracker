# Bus-Tracker
## Description
This app pulls all the information for the busses on Route 1 (route that runs near MIT campus) on [MBTA](https://ww.mbta.com) and places markers on the map. It updates every marker every 15 seconds.
## How to Run
Load the page and press the "Start Boston Bus Tracking" button at the top left of the screen. You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in on the map.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
- Add info for each marker that states bus number
- Add click buttons for zooming in and out
- Add ability to chage routes and cities
